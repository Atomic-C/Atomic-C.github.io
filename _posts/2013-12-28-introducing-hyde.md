title: Hi, I’m Pedro, .NET Developer.
---

An ambitious school leaver with strong grades and a commitment to pursuing a career in coding. Completed an enjoyable period of work experience at Casino Azores, demonstrating a natural aptitude for interacting with customers and providing service with a smile. Studied at OpenClassrooms, achieving .NET developer course. Keen to secure an entry-level junior backend developer role, which will provide opportunities for further development and progression.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
